By extracting rich spatial and molecular information from tissues, we aim to better understand how tumors grow, respond to treatments and interact with their surroundings. In our lab, we have developed colocatome frameworks to map and quantify in situ cellular organization, revealing how microenvironments regulate cell behavior. In parallel, we extract reproducible radiomic features such as texture, intensity and shape, together with quantitative MRI metrics like relaxation times, and apply interpretable machine-learning models to link these imaging biomarkers to clinical outcomes. This enables precise tumor localization and non-invasive monitoring of disease progression.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="quantitative-imaging-and-spatial-analysis">Quantitative Imaging and Spatial Analysis&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Our work focuses on developing computational frameworks to analyze high-resolution multiplex microscopy images of tissues such as bone marrow, generated by &lt;a href="https://www.kokkaliarislab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quantitative Spatial Cancer Biology - Kokkaliaris lab&lt;/a>. We specialize in extracting spatial and morphological features from complex, multi-modal image data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have developed a framework that enables the integration and analysis of multiple biological replicates with complementary information in a shared spatial reference space. Building on this, we established a pipeline to extract and quantify spatial remodeling of the cellular neighborhood during the aging process. These tools allow us to investigate how hematopoietic stem cells, blood vessels, megakaryocytes, adipocytes, and stromal components are spatially organized and how these patterns evolve with age or in response to treatment.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="radiomics-and-quantitative-mri">Radiomics and Quantitative MRI&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Our imaging research also includes radiological data analysis, with a focus on transitioning from qualitative interpretation to quantitative, reproducible metrics. In radiomics, we extract features such as texture, intensity, and shape from defined regions of interest within MRI scans, and use machine learning models to link these features to clinical outcomes. We emphasize interpretability and robustness, testing models on controlled environments to avoid confounding due to real-patient variability and ethical exposure limitations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In parallel, we employ quantitative MRI (qMRI) techniques to move beyond traditional contrast-based imaging. By measuring intrinsic physical properties of tissues, e.g. relaxation times, we obtain microstructural insights into tissue composition, particularly in brain imaging. Combining qMRI with machine learning enables precise localization of tumors and assessment of disease progression, further enhancing the clinical utility of radiological data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Computational Molecular Medicine</title><link>https://mlo-lab.github.io/project/single-cell/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 22:36:09 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mlo-lab.github.io/project/single-cell/</guid><description>&lt;p>Single-cell multi-omics data offer powerful opportunities to study disease at unprecedented resolution, but they also present significant challenges. The data are often sparse, noisy, and extremely high-dimensional, with technical differences between batches or donors that can obscure true biological signals. Our lab combines advanced computational methods with high-dimensional biological data to exludes technical artifacts and uncover mechanisms of disease progresssion and therapy response, with a particular emphasis on cancer and metabolic disorder.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="single-cell-multi-omics-for-clinical-cohorts">Single-Cell Multi-Omics for Clinical Cohorts&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We specialize in the analysis of clinical single-cell multi-omics datasets, particularly from cancer and metabolic disease cohorts. Using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, we analyze single-cell RNA sequencing and chromatin accessibility data to characterize cellular heterogeneity and regulatory dynamics. Our pipeline includes robust dimensionality reduction, clustering, and batch correction methods, allowing us to identify distinct cell populations and states across individuals. Through probabilistic graphical modeling and motif enrichment analysis, we reconstruct gene regulatory networks that govern disease-specific transcriptional programs. These approaches allow us to overcome the sparsity and noise inherent to single-cell data and extract biologically meaningful patterns that inform prognosis and therapeutic strategy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="multi-omics-for-mouse-models-of-cancer-progression">Multi-Omics for Mouse Models of Cancer Progression&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To explore tumor development and treatment effects in vivo, we analyze multi-omics data generated from mouse models, including xenografts and genetically induced cancers. These datasets are complex, encompassing multiple axes of variation such as treatment regimens, time points, and tumor subtypes. To disentangle these factors, we develop tailored probabilistic latent variable models (LVMs) that reveal how sources of variability interact and which molecular features are relevant to human disease.
Recent projects:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Multi-Omics combined with &lt;strong>lineage tracing&lt;/strong> technology now allow us to quantify the clonal connectivity between different cell populations and infer the temporal dynamics of cell populations. Using mechanistic modeling, we can uncover the directionality of differentiation trajectories and the dynamical properties of the clones [&lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.10.674954v1.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pdf&lt;/a>].&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Analyzing cancerous mouse models provides valuable insights for developing &lt;strong>personalized oncology&lt;/strong> approaches. We will integrate patient data at an early stage in this process using a forward and reverse translation technique. This method ensures that the results are clinically relevant and enables us to identify patients who are eligible for a new treatment. For example, we are working on a TRR project that investigates how ubiquitination impacts DNA damage repair in AML in order to identify a new anticancer target [&lt;a href="https://ubiqancer.de/project/a13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project&lt;/a>].&lt;/p>
