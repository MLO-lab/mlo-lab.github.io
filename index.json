Robust normalization, dimensionality reduction, and noise-modeling approaches are therefore essential to recover reliable signals and ensure that downstream analyses reflect genuine cellular heterogeneity rather than artifacts of the technology. Our lab combines advanced computational methods with high-dimensional biological data to uncover mechanisms of disease, with a particular emphasis on cancer and metabolic disorders. By integrating single-cell multi-omics, and in vivo model data, we aim to build a mechanistic and spatially resolved understanding of disease progression and therapeutic response.\nSingle-Cell Multi-Omics in Clinical Cohorts We specialize in the analysis of clinical single-cell multi-omics datasets, particularly from cancer and metabolic disease cohorts. Using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, we analyze single-cell RNA sequencing and chromatin accessibility data to characterize cellular heterogeneity and regulatory dynamics. Our pipeline includes robust dimensionality reduction, clustering, and batch correction methods, allowing us to identify distinct cell populations and states across individuals. Through probabilistic graphical modeling and motif enrichment analysis, we reconstruct gene regulatory networks that govern disease-specific transcriptional programs. These approaches allow us to overcome the sparsity and noise inherent to single-cell data and extract biologically meaningful patterns that inform prognosis and therapeutic strategy.\nMulti-Omics in Mouse Models of Cancer To explore tumor development and treatment effects in vivo, we analyze multi-omics data generated from mouse models, including xenografts and genetically induced cancers. These datasets are complex, encompassing multiple axes of variation such as treatment regimens, time points, and tumor subtypes. To disentangle these factors, we develop tailored probabilistic latent variable models (LVMs) that reveal how sources of variability interact and which molecular features are relevant to human disease. This framework enables us to translate findings from experimental models into clinically actionable insights.\n","date":1749587769,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1749587769,"objectID":"8cb5ef72bd1e85ab5e69d2d641443a3b","permalink":"https://mlo-lab.github.io/project_new/single-cell/","publishdate":"2025-06-10T22:36:09+02:00","relpermalink":"/project_new/single-cell/","section":"project_new","summary":" Single-cell multi-omics data present unique challenges.

In parallel, we extract reproducible radiomic features (texture, intensity, shape) and qMRI metrics (e.g., relaxation times) from MRI scans and deploy interpretable machine-learning models to link these imaging biomarkers to clinical outcomes, enabling precise tumor localization and non-invasive monitoring of disease progression.\nQuantitative Imaging and Spatial Analysis We apply quantitative imaging to transform biological images into measurable, interpretable data. From advanced multiplex platforms such as confocal microscopy and imaging flow cytometry, we obtain high-dimensional spatial and phenotypic profiles of cells in their native tissue context. Unlike bulk or sequencing-based approaches, this imaging allows us to retain crucial information on cell location, identity, and interaction.\nA major component of our spatial analysis pipeline is the development of colocatome frameworks, which quantify the organization and interaction of cell populations in situ. For example, we investigate the spatial positioning of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) within bone marrow niches using high-resolution microscopy. Understanding these spatial relationships is essential for revealing how microenvironments regulate stem cell behavior and lineage commitment.\nRadiomics and Quantitative MRI Our imaging research also includes radiological data analysis, with a focus on transitioning from qualitative interpretation to quantitative, reproducible metrics. In radiomics, we extract features such as texture, intensity, and shape from defined regions of interest within MRI scans, and use machine learning models to link these features to clinical outcomes. We emphasize interpretability and robustness, testing models on controlled environments to avoid confounding due to real-patient variability and ethical exposure limitations.\nIn parallel, we employ quantitative MRI (qMRI) techniques to move beyond traditional contrast-based imaging. By measuring intrinsic physical properties of tissues, e.g. relaxation times, we obtain microstructural insights into tissue composition, particularly in brain imaging. Combining qMRI with machine learning enables precise localization of tumors and assessment of disease progression, further enhancing the clinical utility of radiological data.\n","date":1749587769,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1749587769,"objectID":"563eefd7afefdbeb7585a10e2a896eb5","permalink":"https://mlo-lab.github.io/project_new/medical-imaging/","publishdate":"2025-06-10T22:36:09+02:00","relpermalink":"/project_new/medical-imaging/","section":"project_new","summary":"High-dimensional imaging datasets pose significant challenges in quantification and interpretation.

In our lab, we develop probabilistic models for the integration of multi-omics datasets, where each patient is described by diverse molecular layers such as genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. These models uncover hidden structure in the data by capturing both shared and modality-specific sources of variation. This allows us to reduce noise, infer biologically meaningful patterns, and model system-level responses to perturbations such as drug treatments or environmental changes. Our goal is to produce representations that are not only statistically robust, but also interpretable, resulting in novel biological insights can be directly extracted and validated.\nMuVI MuVI is a general-purpose probabilistic latent variable model for multi-omics integration that incorporates prior biological knowledge into its structure. It uses pathway annotations, gene sets, or cell-type signatures to guide the discovery of latent factors that explain variation across different data types. Even when this prior knowledge is noisy or incomplete, MuVI is able to learn biologically relevant dimensions, enabling scientists to interpret the sources of variation in the data more clearly and to relate them to known mechanisms. MUSIC MUSIC (MUltiview baySIan tensor deComposition) extends probabilistic modeling to high-dimensional array data, such as time-series or condition-specific measurements. It jointly decomposes collections of heterogeneous tensors, e.g. patient × gene × time or patient × protein × condition, into shared and modality-specific components. With structured sparsity priors and efficient variational inference, MUSIC scales to large datasets, handles missing data, and yields interpretable embeddings. We have applied it to cancer drug-response studies and single-cell leukemia data, where it revealed meaningful molecular signatures associated with disease pathways.\nMOMO-GP MOMO-GP (Multi-Omic Multi-output Gaussian Processes) addresses the challenge of learning interpretable representations from single-cell multi-omics data, which are typically high-dimensional, sparse, and nonlinear. Unlike traditional methods that trade off interpretability for modeling power, MOMO-GP combines neural networks with Gaussian Processes to achieve both. It learns separate latent embeddings for cells and features, as well as shared and modality-specific components in the multi-view setting. By modeling gene relevance explicitly, MOMO-GP connects cell clusters to marker genes, making the learned structure readily interpretable in biological terms.\nJOANA JOANA is a probabilistic model for pathway enrichment analysis (PEA) that overcomes limitations of classical approaches like Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) and Functional Class Scoring (FCS). While methods such as GSEA work with continuous scores, they typically operate on a single omics layer and can yield overly broad sets of enriched pathways. JOANA improves on this by modeling enrichment scores across multiple omics layers using mixtures of beta distributions within a Bayesian framework. This allows it to estimate the probability of pathway enrichment both within and across modalities, yielding higher precision and more biologically relevant results.\nMOFAFLEX MOFAFLEX is our upcoming framework for flexible and interpretable multi-omics integration. Designed to generalize the principles behind models like MuVI and MUSIC, MOFAFLEX supports heterogeneous data types, modular priors, and scalable inference. Its architecture allows for tailored modeling of real-world datasets, balancing interpretability with modeling flexibility. MOFAFLEX is currently under active development and will provide a unified foundation for future applications in cancer biology and beyond.\n","date":1749586260,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1749586260,"objectID":"37ac476f1b19ff3a83168d58d2da070e","permalink":"https://mlo-lab.github.io/project_new/multi-omics/","publishdate":"2025-06-10T22:11:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/project_new/multi-omics/","section":"project_new","summary":"Understanding the complexity of cancer requires making sense of equally complex biological data.

In genomic medicine, for instance, a patient can be described by data from different molecular layers. This raises the need for multi-view models that are able to disentangle variation within and across data views in an interpretable manner. Latent variable models with structured sparsity are a commonly used tool to address this modeling task but interpretability is cumbersome since it requires a direct inspection and interpretation of each factor via a specialized domain expert. Here, we propose MuVI, a novel approach for domain-informed multi-view latent variable models, facilitating the analysis of multi-view data in an inherently explainable manner. We demonstrate that our model (i) is able to integrate noisy domain expertise in from of feature sets, (ii) is robust to noise in the encoded domain knowledge, (iii) results in identifiable factors and (iv) is able to infer interpretable and biologically meaningful axes of variation in real-world multi-view datasets.\nGet started right away with MuVI!\n","date":1647964456,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647964456,"objectID":"9c3d73f358f6b31e3762faa8811bf4b4","permalink":"https://mlo-lab.github.io/project/muvi/","publishdate":"2022-03-22T16:54:16+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/muvi/","section":"project","summary":"A multi-view latent variable model with structured sparsity that integrates noisy domain expertise in terms of feature sets.","tags":["latent variable models","multi-omics","domain expertise"],"title":"MuVI","type":"project"},{"authors":["Sebastian Gruber","Florian Buettner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1742309869,"objectID":"7b40e21973fa89f687ec47505fe1b908","permalink":"https://mlo-lab.github.io/publication/gruber-2022-better/","publishdate":"2025-03-18T14:57:49.035112Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gruber-2022-better/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Better uncertainty calibration via proper scores for classification and beyond","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adele M Nicolas","Marina Pesic","Esther Engel","Paul K Ziegler","Markus Diefenhardt","Kilian B Kennel","Florian Buettner","Claire Conche","Valentina Petrocelli","Eiman Elwakeel"," others"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648718393,"objectID":"9c8f947c36506c939420734145d01554","permalink":"https://mlo-lab.github.io/publication/nicolas-2022-inflammatory/","publishdate":"2022-06-30T10:08:27.774984Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nicolas-2022-inflammatory/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Inflammatory fibroblasts mediate resistance to neoadjuvant therapy in rectal cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fernando Anjos-Afonso","Florian Buettner","Syed A Mian","Hefin Rhys","Jimena Perez-Lloret","Manuel Garcia-Albornoz","Namrata Rastogi","Linda Ariza-McNaughton","Dominique Bonnet"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657295033,"objectID":"0bf87206eb3d20733207971ebce6822b","permalink":"https://mlo-lab.github.io/publication/anjos-2022-single/","publishdate":"2022-07-08T15:43:53.454832Z","relpermalink":"/publication/anjos-2022-single/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Single cell analyses identify a highly regenerative and homogenous human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell population","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashok Kumar Jayavelu","Sebastian Wolf","Florian Buettner","Gabriela Alexe","Björn Häupl","Federico Comoglio","Constanze Schneider","Carmen Doebele","Dominik C Fuhrmann","Sebastian Wagner"," others"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648718393,"objectID":"45cf3f2f9a91e3e41f15d688d80c084b","permalink":"https://mlo-lab.github.io/publication/jayavelu-2022-proteogenomic/","publishdate":"2022-06-30T10:08:27.615777Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jayavelu-2022-proteogenomic/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The proteogenomic subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arber Qoku"],"categories":["publication"],"content":"Latent variable models are powerful statistical tools that can uncover relevant variation between patients or cells, by inferring unobserved hidden states from observable high-dimensional data.

These data can impact positively on the development of data-driven health care including precision medicine and precision public health. In recent years, large scale medical/clinical datasets, such as “omics” data and radiology reports are increasingly available. We have also witnessed an increasing number of successful AI/ML applications using such datasets to address problems such as drug repurposing and preliminary screening of radiology reports. To facilitate the adoption of such AI/ML in practice, we have simultaneously witnessed an increasing adoption/innovation of using explainability methods to analyze/present AI for Health. In this deep learning era, What is the current status of AI/ML applications in healthcare? What are the standard methods of explaining such AI models for healthcare? What are the roles of causality in AI/ML practices? What are the state-of-the-art developments in causal AI in health and health care domains? What are the limitations and how are the different facets of trust and explanations (see figure 1 below) being addressed in practice? Can knowledge-backed AI lead to more robust and interpretable models? How do data scientists and physicians apply this knowledge in collaboration and via human-centered AI approaches to further the field and improve healthcare? How are regulatory requirements for transparency and trustworthiness of models and data privacy being defined and how can they be fulfilled? After witnessing so many great achievements from deep learning lately, we propose to invite world-leading experts from both data science and healthcare to discuss and debate the path forward for practical applications of AI/ML in healthcare, including demos, early work, and critiques on the current state and the path forward for explainability and trustworthiness in AI. More specifically, we plan to attract high-quality original research from emerging areas with significant implications in healthcare and invite open discussions on controversial yet crucial topics regarding healthcare transformation\nKey dates  Paper Submission opens: Apr 15, 2021 Paper Submission deadline: May 10, 2021 Acceptance Notice: Jun 10, 2021 Workshop Date: Aug 14, 2021  All deadlines correspond to 11:59 PM Hawaii Standard Time ( HST).\n","date":1618272e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618272e3,"objectID":"13e6a3ff66cf703a79bfb563cc744c89","permalink":"https://mlo-lab.github.io/post/workshop/","publishdate":"2021-04-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/workshop/","section":"post","summary":"We organize a workshop at this year\u0026rsquo;s KDD\nCheck out the workshop website here.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a widely used routine assay and recent scRNA-seq protocols now allow to obtain an unbiased profile of transcriptional heterogeneity at a genome-wide scale, which can be scaled to large datasets with up to millions of cells. Analysis of such data is challenging: As the intrinsic cellular state of individual cells cannot be directly assayed, cell states need to be inferred from the transcriptional profiling data itself. To this end, single-cell profiling data pose new challenges and opportunities to derive powerful latent variable models (LVMs) that help to exploit large datasets.\nVisualization of latent cell states We have developed several tools tailored towards inferring and visualizing internal cell states. This includes inferring the internal cell-cycle state of individual cells via Gaussian Process Latent Variabe Models (GPLVM), as well as GPLVM-based identification of cell subpopulations. In addition, we have created tools based on diffusion maps that allow to recover the intrinsic order of cels, e.g. in terms of their differentiation state.\nIdentification of sources of cell-cell variation Cell-cell variability in terms of gene expression results from a variety of potential sources, including technical noise, biological variation of interest and unwanted biologicl variation (e.g. mitochonrial genes, cell cycle state, etc.). To disentangle these sources of variation, we designed slalom, an interpretable latent variable model that addresses three key tasks in computational scRNA-seq\n Disentagling biological and technical sources of variation Visualizing the pathways driving cell-cell variation Refining pathway annotations in an experiment-specific manner  ","date":1617926400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617926400,"objectID":"a613a3c3875d4ba87b7b444464542cfc","permalink":"https://mlo-lab.github.io/project/single-cell/","publishdate":"2021-04-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/single-cell/","section":"project","summary":"Tools and algorithms for the analysis of single-cell data","tags":["single-cell"],"title":"Computational single-cell biology","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Multi‐omics studies promise the improved characterization of biological processes across molecular layers. However, methods for the integration of the resulting heterogeneous data sets are lacking. We develop tools and algorithms for the supervised as well as unsupervised integration of such data.\nUnsupervised data integration For example, we present Multi‐Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA), an unsupervised computational method for discovering the principal sources of variation in multi‐omics data sets. MOFA infers a set of (hidden) factors that capture biological and technical sources of variability. It disentangles axes of heterogeneity that are shared across multiple modalities and those specific to individual data modalities. The learnt factors enable a variety of downstream analyses, including identification of sample subgroups, data imputation and the detection of outlier samples. We applied MOFA to a cohort of 200 patient samples of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, profiled for somatic mutations, RNA expression, DNA methylation and ex vivo drug responses. MOFA identified major dimensions of disease heterogeneity, including immunoglobulin heavy‐chain variable region status, trisomy of chromosome 12 and previously underappreciated drivers, such as response to oxidative stress. In close collaboration with the Oellerich group in Frankfurt, we use MOFA to elucidate the proteogenomic landscape in a range of cancers. In addition, we use MOFA to analyse single‐cell multi‐omics data, for example identifying coordinated transcriptional and epigenetic changes along cell differentiation and analysing the epigenetic landscape during mammalian germ layer specification.\nSupervised analysis of multi-omics data In addition to these unsupevised approaches, we also develop tools for integrative gene-set enrichment analyses in supervised multi-omics settings. In particular, our algorithm MONA and its accompanying webservice RAMONA use a Bayesian approach with a computationally efficient method to approximate the marginal posteriors of ontology terms, given lists of genes responding to experimental conditions. MONA is designed to easily handle any combination of molecular levels in a modular fashion.\n","date":1617926400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617926400,"objectID":"1c7d67eeb0f7b3b3ed37e340da918236","permalink":"https://mlo-lab.github.io/project/mofa/","publishdate":"2021-04-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/mofa/","section":"project","summary":"Tools and algorithms for the supervised as well as unsupervised integration of multi-omics data","tags":["multi-omics"],"title":"Multi-omics data integration","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Latent variable models (LVMs) are a statistical tool to infer an unobserved, hidden state of a complex (e.g. biological) system based on observable data that is often high-dimensional.

However, such systems require not only high accuracy, but also reliable and calibrated uncertainty estimates. Especially in safety critical applications in medicine where average case performance is insufficient, practitioners need to have access to reliable predictive uncertainty during the entire lifecycle of the model. This means confidence scores (or predictive uncertainty) should be meaningful not only for in-domain predictions, but also under gradual domain drift where the distribution of the input samples gradually changes from in-domain to truly out-ofdistribution (OOD). In healthcare, common examples of such domain shift scenarios are a patient demographic that changes over time or new hospitals in which a model is to be deployed.\nTowards Trustworthy Predictions from Deep Neural Networks with Fast Adversarial Calibration Here, we propose an efficient yet general modelling approach for obtaining wellcalibrated, trustworthy probabilities for samples obtained after a domain shift. We introduce a new training strategy combining an entropy-encouraging loss term with an adversarial calibration loss term and demonstrate that this results in well-calibrated and technically trustworthy predictions for a wide range of domain drifts. We comprehensively evaluate previously proposed approaches on different data modalities, a large range of data sets including sequence data, network architectures and perturbation strategies. We observe that our modelling approach substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, yielding well-calibrated predictions under domain drift.\nReference: Tomani \u0026amp; Buettner, AAAI 2021\nPost-hoc Uncertainty Calibration for Domain Drift Scenarios We address the problem of uncertainty calibration. While standard deep neural networks typically yield uncalibrated predictions, calibrated confidence scores that are representative of the true likelihood of a prediction can be achieved using post-hoc calibration methods. However, to date the focus of these approaches has been on in-domain calibration. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we show that existing post-hoc calibration methods yield highly over-confident predictions under domain shift. Second, we introduce a simple strategy where perturbations are applied to samples in the validation set before performing the post-hoc calibration step. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that this perturbation step results in substantially better calibration under domain shift on a wide range of architectures and modelling tasks.\nReference: Tomani, Gruber, Erdem, Cremers \u0026amp; Buettner, CVPR 2021 (oral presentation)\nParameterized Temperature Scaling for Boosting the Expressive Power in Post-Hoc Uncertainty Calibration We address the problem of uncertainty calibration and introduce a novel calibration method, Parametrized Temperature Scaling (PTS). Standard deep neural networks typically yield uncalibrated predictions, which can be transformed into calibrated confidence scores using post-hoc calibration methods. In this contribution, we demonstrate that the performance of accuracy-preserving state-ofthe-art post-hoc calibrators is limited by their intrinsic expressive power. We generalize temperature scaling by computing predictionspecific temperatures, parameterized by a neural network. We show with extensive experiments that our novel accuracy-preserving approach consistently outperforms existing algorithms across a large number of model architectures, datasets and metrics.\nReference: Tomani, Cremers \u0026amp; Buettner, arxiv 2021 (in submission)\n","date":1617926400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617926400,"objectID":"3afc6721c54822ea3dcdc966be216a16","permalink":"https://mlo-lab.github.io/project/calibration/","publishdate":"2021-04-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/calibration/","section":"project","summary":"Uncertainty-aware supervised machine learning with deep neural networks for real-world applications","tags":["deep learning","calibration"],"title":"Uncertainty-aware deep learning in the real world","type":"project"},{"authors":["Xudong Sun","Florian Buettner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648718393,"objectID":"96038f1325dcb555eb8b5fccd97598ad","permalink":"https://mlo-lab.github.io/publication/sun-2021-hierarchical/","publishdate":"2022-06-30T10:08:27.847242Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sun-2021-hierarchical/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Hierarchical Domain Invariant Variational Auto-Encoding with weak domain supervision","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yinchong Yang","Florian Buettner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648718393,"objectID":"46140514097e259ffb9795e28ccaaf97","permalink":"https://mlo-lab.github.io/publication/yang-2021-multi/","publishdate":"2022-06-30T10:08:28.062755Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yang-2021-multi/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Multi-output Gaussian Processes for uncertainty-aware recommender systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christian Tomani","Daniel Cremers","Florian Buettner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648718393,"objectID":"c50670d510b9b6bdc4c1ba202de00574","permalink":"https://mlo-lab.github.io/publication/tomani-2021-parameterized/","publishdate":"2022-06-30T10:08:27.991859Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tomani-2021-parameterized/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Parameterized Temperature Scaling for Boosting the Expressive Power in Post-Hoc Uncertainty Calibration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christian Tomani","Florian Buettner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648718393,"objectID":"b69dd86c894ce43f841d1eaf0ec84f7e","permalink":"https://mlo-lab.github.io/publication/tomani-2021-towards/","publishdate":"2022-06-30T10:08:27.919436Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tomani-2021-towards/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Towards trustworthy predictions from deep neural networks with fast adversarial calibration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christian Tomani","Sebastian Gruber","Muhammed Ebrar Erdem","Daniel Cremers","Florian Buettner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648718393,"objectID":"beac4119a0020f9849411b0ab3eefc64","permalink":"https://mlo-lab.github.io/publication/tomani-post-hoc-2020/","publishdate":"2022-06-30T10:08:28.279028Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tomani-post-hoc-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Post-hoc Uncertainty Calibration for Domain Drift Scenarios","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anna SE Cuomo","Daniel D.
