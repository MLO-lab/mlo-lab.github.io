  abstract  = {We study the problem of monitoring machine learning models under gradual distribution shifts, where circumstances change slowly over time, often leading to unnoticed yet significant declines in accuracy. To address this, we propose Incremental Uncertainty-aware Performance Monitoring (IUPM), a novel label-free method that estimates performance changes by modeling gradual shifts using optimal transport. In addition, IUPM quantifies the uncertainty in the performance prediction and introduces an active labeling procedure to restore a reliable estimate under a limited labeling budget. Our experiments show that IUPM outperforms existing performance estimation baselines in various gradual shift scenarios and that its uncertainty awareness guides label acquisition more effectively compared to other strategies.},

  abstract  = {Learning representations of single-cell genomics data is challenging due to the nonlinear and often multi-modal nature of the data on one hand and the need for interpretable representations on the other hand. Existing approaches tend to focus either on interpretability aspects via linear matrix factorization or on maximizing expressive power via neural network-based embeddings using black-box variational autoencoders or graph embedding approaches. We address this trade-off between expressive power and interpretability by introducing a novel approach that combines highly expressive representation learning via an embedding layer with interpretable multi-output Gaussian processes within a unified framework. In our model, we learn distinct representations for samples (cells) and features (genes) from multi-modal single-cell data. We demonstrate that even a few interpretable latent dimensions can effectively capture the underlying structure of the data. Our model yields interpretable relationships between groups of cells and their associated marker genes: leveraging a gene relevance map, we establish connections between cell clusters (e.g. specific cell types) and feature clusters (e.g. marker genes for those specific cell types) within the learned latent spaces of cells and features.},
